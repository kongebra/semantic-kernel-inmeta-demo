## retry 1

Tried to remove trailing slash from API endpoint, did not work

From: `https://sveinopenaitest.openai.azure.com/`, To: `https://sveinopenaitest.openai.azure.com`

## retry 2

I changed `dotnet user-secrets set "AzureOpenAI:ChatCompletionDeploymentName" "gpt-35-turbo"` to `dotnet user-secrets set "AzureOpenAI:ChatCompletionDeploymentName" "sveinchat"`

Needs to be specified that we need to use the deployment name for the deployment we made in Azure OpenAI Studio

### comment

![Alt text](image.png)

this image shows the Azure AI Studio, but the key and endpoint is located in Azure Portal? Somewhat unclear

# SK plugin

work great!
